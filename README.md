# Elon Reads

Elon Reads is a showcase of books that inspire Elon Musk, built using modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

The frontend of the website is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by a MySQL database from PlanetScale. This combination of technologies provides a fast, scalable, and responsive user experience for visitors to the website. The deployment happens on Vercel.

## Contributing

To be honest, this is my very first (and quite small) open-source project, so I don't know how this works on GitHub. But if you want to suggest or make any changes, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## About Me

My name is Jan, and I am a developer and entrepreneur passionate about creating innovative solutions that make a positive impact in the world. With Elon Reads, I hope to inspire others to read and learn from the books that have influenced one of the most visionary leaders of our time.
